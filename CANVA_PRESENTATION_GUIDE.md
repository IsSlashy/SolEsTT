### **SLIDE 6: Feature #1 - Tokenization**

**Title:** Transform Real Estate into NFTs

**How it Works:**
1. **Property Creation**

2. **Tokenization**
   - Property converted to Solana NFT
   - Metadata stored on-chain
   - Verifiable and transparent ownership

3. **Fractionalization**
   - Creation of SPL tokens (e.g., 1000 tokens)
   - Each token = 1/1000th of property
   - Price per token: Total value / Number of tokens

**Concrete Example:**
- Paris 16th Apartment: €500,000
- 1000 tokens created
- Price per token: €500
- Minimum investment: €100 (0.2 token)

**Visual:** Screenshot of "Create Property" page or process diagram
