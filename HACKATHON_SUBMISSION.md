- ‚úÖ **After:** Fractional ownership from $100, liquid secondary markets

- ‚ùå **Before:** Slow rental payments, manual income distribution
- ‚úÖ **After:** Instant USDC payments, automated distribution to all shareholders

- ‚ùå **Before:** Traditional mortgages take weeks, require banks
- ‚úÖ **After:** Decentralized loans in hours, community-funded pools
